A set of engine modifications for the classic game Fallout 2 in the form of a DLL, which modifies executable in memory without changing anything in EXE file itself.

**Engine modifications include:**
- Better support for modern operating systems
- Externalizing many settings like starting map and game time, skills, perks, critical hit tables, books, etc.
- Bug fixes
- Many additional features for users, such as item highlight button, party member control, etc.
- Extended scripting capabilities for modders (many new opcodes to control sfall features as well as previously unavailable vanilla engine functions)
