- allows the player to gain a positive reputation when killing NPCs while controlling other critters (optional)
- a notification box to display the name of the controlled critter above the interface bar (optional)


Requires sfall 3.8.40 or higher.

To use, copy gl_partycontrol_lite.int to your scripts folder and sfall-mods.ini (in ItemHighlight_Lite) to the mods folder in the same directory as sfall.
