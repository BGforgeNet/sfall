NPC Armor Appearance mod
------------------------

This is the same mod as the one included in sfall 4.x modders pack. Used to replace the scripted part of B-Team mod.
Appropriate graphics are required for this mod to work, or you can set party members to use player's armor appearance instead.
Can be adopted to any mod by adjusting armor PIDs, allowed weapon anim codes, NPC PIDs and NPC FIDs in INI file.


Requires sfall 3.8.29 or higher

To use, copy gl_npcarmor.int to your scripts folder, and copy npcarmor.ini to the same directory as sfall.

The default npcarmor.ini is set up for Restoration Project 2.3.3.
Check the included "npcarmor - vanilla.ini" for an example that does not require any new graphics.
