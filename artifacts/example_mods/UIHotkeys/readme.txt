UI Hotkeys mod for Fallout 2 by NovaRain
----------------------------------------

- closes some game interfaces by pressing their hotkeys again:
  * 'I' key for Inventory
  * 'S' key for Skilldex
  * 'Z' key for Pip-Boy

- extends the functionality of the 'Space' key (Caps Lock must be off):
  * takes all items in the loot screen
  * makes the offer in the barter screen

- Note:
  * the uppercase 'A' (shift + A if Caps Lock is off) is the built-in hotkey for the TAKE ALL button on the loot screen
  * the lowercase 'm' is the built-in hotkey for the OFFER button on the barter screen

To use, copy gl_uihotkeys.int to your scripts folder.

This mod is a simple example of how you can use HOOK_KEYPRESS hooks.
