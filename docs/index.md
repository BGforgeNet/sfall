# Sfall

Sfall is a set of engine modifications for the classic game Fallout 2 in form of a DLL, which modifies executable in memory without changing anything in EXE file itself.

Engine modifications include:

* Better support for modern operating systems
* Externalizing many settings like starting map and game time, skills, perks, critical hit tables, books, etc.
* Bug fixes
* Many additional features for users, such as item highlight button, party member control, etc.
* Extended scripting capabilities for modders (many new opcodes to control sfall features as well as previously unavailable vanilla engine functions)
